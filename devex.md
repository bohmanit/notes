# 🎯 Positioning: Modern DevEx

> DevEx is **not about building infrastructure or platforms for their own sake** —  
> it’s about **reducing cognitive load**,  
> **enabling self-service**, and  
> **boosting productivity & happiness**.

<!--
Vision:

  - Emphasize this is a **vision statement**, not just a definition.  
  - Call out that infra/platform can exist, but they are only **means to an end**.

# Modern vs Traditional DevEX Metrics

| <span style="color: white;">**Traditional Metrics**</span> | <span style="color: white;">**Modern DevEx Metrics**</span> |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Lines of code | Time to first PR |
| Deployment frequency | Developer satisfaction scores |
| Bug count | Time to resolve blockers |
| System uptime | Onboarding time (days → hours) |
| Code coverage % | Feature delivery velocity |
| Infrastructure costs | Developer productivity index |

**Modern DevEx = Developer-Centric Measurements + Business Impact**
