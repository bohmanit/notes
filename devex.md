# 🎯 Positioning: Modern DevEx

> DevEx is **not about building infrastructure or platforms for their own sake** —  
> it’s about **reducing cognitive load**,  
> **enabling self-service**, and  
> **boosting productivity & happiness**.

<!--
Vision:

  - Emphasize this is a **vision statement**, not just a definition.  
  - Call out that infra/platform can exist, but they are only **means to an end**.
